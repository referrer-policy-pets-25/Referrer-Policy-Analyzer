# RP-Analyzer
Analyse the implementation and circumvention of the referrer policy. 

To utilise this module, you have two options:
1. **Implementation of the RP:** To analyse the data for implementation, execute all notebooks in the [01_extractor](/01_extractor/) folder. Upon completion, proceed to the [implementation](/03_analyzer/0301_implement/) section.
2. **Circumvention of the RP:** To analyse the circumvention of the RP, execute [request_extractor](/01_extractor/request_extractor.ipynb), followed by [Leak detector](/02_processor/0201_leak_detect.ipynb) and [circumvention detector](/02_processor/0202_circum_detect.ipynb) (consecutively). Subsequently, execute all notebooks in the [circumvention](/03_analyzer/0302_circum/) section.
